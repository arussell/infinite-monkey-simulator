What is the Monkey Simulator?
=============================

If a monkey is sat at a typewriter for an infinite amount of time, how long would it take to write the entire works of Shakespeare? The monkey simulator gives you your very own monkey and typewriter, so you can find out for yourself.

The monkey simulator was written by [Aaron B. Russell](http://unadopted.co.uk) for an episode of the BBC Two television programme [Horizon](http://bbc.co.uk/horizon). You can find out more information about the programme [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00qszch), and you can watch it online at [BBC iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00qszch) ([also in HD](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00qszch/hd])) between February 10, 2010 and February 24, 2010.

I have a Mac. Can I just download the simulator and run it myself?
==================================================================

Yes, definitely! Grab a copy from the left hand side of this page. It requires at least Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), because it uses Grand Central Dispatch to manage threading.

I have a Windows/Linux based computer. Can I run the simulator too?
===================================================================

Unfortunately the Monkey Simulator takes advantage of some Mac OS X specific features, and needs to be rewritten to run under other operating systems. That said, never say never. If you're interested in getting it going, read the next question.

I want to make it work on Windows or Linux/I want to fix a bug. Can I get the source code?
==========================================================================================

By all means. Visit [https://github.com/arussell/infinite-monkey-simulator](https://github.com/arussell/infinite-monkey-simulator) to get your own copy of the code from the Git repository.

I want to make my own product using this. Is that allowed?
